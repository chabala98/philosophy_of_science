## Philosophy_of_life_sciences

This repository is dedicated to our project for the couse Philosophy of life science. We simulate natural selection to deepen our study on the paradox of altruism. The main objective of the simulation is tackle some questions that are hard solve using maths or other analitic tools, and adding complexity simple models found in some papers regarding this topic. 

We start by creating a baseline model used to run simulation used to provide numerical results supporting the claims that are present in 'Samir Okasha, Biological Altruism in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy published by The Metaphysics Research Lab, 2020'.
Then once we are sure that, simulations and claims are providing the same results, we will simulate natural selection in a more complex way in order to have a more sophisticated model that simulate nature a bit better. We will study the paradox of altruism in this new simulated world and study the paradox of altruism there.

- [philo.ipynb](philo.ipynb) : This notebook contains the first baseline simulation of natural selection. This simulation is used to provide numerical simulation supporting the claims that are present in 'Samir Okasha, Biological Altruism in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy published by The Metaphysics Research Lab, 2020'.
